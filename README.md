# My Leetcode Diary

*Current version: Mar 02, 2024*

<!-- ## Introduction -->
## Introduction
This repository provides my solutions to the [Leetcode problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/). I will keep it updated according to my progress. 

## Structure
Leetcode contains a ton of problems, each problem requires a set of skills. Furthermore, these skills are categorized into 3 groups:
- **[Fundamental Skills](https://github.com/huynhthaihoa/my-leetcode-diary/wiki/Fundamental-Skills)** consists of these skills: **Array**, **String**, **Sorting**, **Two Pointers**, **Simulation**, **Matrix**, **Stack**, **Linked List**.
- **[Intermediate Skills](https://github.com/huynhthaihoa/my-leetcode-diary/wiki/Intermediate-Skills)** consists of these skills: **Hash Table**, **Math**, **Binary Search**, **Greedy**, **Bit Manipulation**, **Design**, **Tree**, **Depth-First Search**.
- **[Advanced Skills](https://github.com/huynhthaihoa/my-leetcode-diary/wiki/Advanced-Skills)** consists of these skills: **Dynamic Programming**, **Divide and Conquer**, **Backtracking**, **Rolling Hash**, **Data Stream**, **Trie**, **Quickselect**, **Union Find**.

For each skill listed above, the list of corresponding problems and their solution are being updated. Each problem contains this information:
- **Number**: the problem number.
- **Difficulty**: difficulty level, one of `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`.
- **Title**: the problem title and the corresponding Leetcode link.
- **Solution**: my solution to the problem, might be implemented in C++, Python, or other languages. Admittedly, most of my solutions are implemented in C++.
- **Status**: status of the solution, one of `AC`, `TLE (x/y)` and `MLE (x/y)`
   - If the status is `AC`, it does mean the solution passes every test case.
   - If the status is `TLE (x/y)`, it does mean the solution gets Time Limit Exceeded after passing `x` test cases over `y` test cases in total.
   - If the status is `MLE (x/y)`, it does mean the solution gets Memory Limit Exceeded after passing `x` test cases over `y` test cases in total.
